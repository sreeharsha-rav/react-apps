## A Repository for My React Apps

Hey there! Welcome to my little corner of the web, where I've stashed some of my React apps. These are just a few projects I've tinkered with for fun. Let's dive into a couple of them:

### [Foodie Finder](https://github.com/sreeharsha-rav/react-apps/tree/main/foodie_finds):
Feeling hungry and adventurous? Foodie Finder is your culinary sidekick, helping you hunt down fantastic dining spots in your neighborhood. Whether you're a foodie pro or just looking for your next yummy meal, this app's got your back.

### [Playlistify](https://github.com/sreeharsha-rav/react-apps/tree/main/playlistify):
If you're all about the beats, check out Playlistify. It's a Single Page Web App (SPA) that lets you groove through Spotify's music library. Craft custom playlists and save 'em right to your Spotify account. Share your musical vibe or discover new tracks â€“ whatever floats your musical boat!

So, these are my humble creations. Feel free to explore them and see what I've cooked up.
